# Overview
C# console application accepts user input to presorted questions, holds answers and sorts users into 1 of 4 available houses depending on answers selected. The questions and answers are read from a .tsv file, and can be modified by the user before runtime.  The target framework for this app is .NET 7.0. 


# Instructions
Using the green 'Code' button above, clone the repo to your local machine.
Open the file Sorting_Hat_Quiz.sln in Visual Studio (or preferred IDE).
Run Debug to begin the application.


#Features
Feature 1: Create a dictionary or a list, populate it with several values (questions/answers/points), retrieve at least one value (each question/answer), and use it in your program.
Feature 2: Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application (file with questions and answers).
Feature 3: Calculate and display data based on an external factor (calculate Hogwarts house based on points given to each answer).
Feature 4: Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program(using NOX to exit the program).
